
Assumptions to run the program:

1- Assume the account is linked to the user's bank account so he can increase his balance as much as he wants.
2- Every going trip has one that is coming back,so the user can buy one way ticket or a round one.
3- drivers don't have the ability to cancel a trip, but they can send a message to the manager, and the manager can take the required actions.
4- whenever a manager cancels a trip a message is automatically sent to all users who have booked the trip to notify them that the trip is cancelled. 
5- whenever a manager removes/adds a driver from/to a trip a message is automatically sent to notify the driver.
6- drivers are notified when trip is assigned to them is canceled.
